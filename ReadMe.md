<!-- ## Task -->
<h2 style="color: #fbb03c;">Task</h2>

Design an algorithm that will group together HTML documents which are similar from the perspective of a user who opens them in a web browser.

<!-- ## Guidelines -->
<h2 style="color: #fbb03c;">Guidelines</h2>

- The dataset contains 4 subdirectories in increasing complexity.
- Your algorithm should work reasonably well on all the “datasets” with no specific optimizations / implementations for one of them.
- Take the time to deeply understand the problem before writing code. Even the most sophisticated solution is ineffective if it solves the wrong problem. Misalignment in problem definition leads to incorrect conclusions and wasted effort.
- Explore this from as many different angles as you can. It will generate valuable questions.
- From a tech stack perspective, you can use any programming language, toolset or libraries you’re comfortable with or find necessary, especially if you know it would be a better option or a more interesting one (we generally prefer Node, Python, Scala).
- At Veridion, we run similar algorithms on billions of records. While your solution doesn’t need to scale to that level, it would be impressive if it does. For now, however, what matters most is your approach to solving the problem—if your solution is exceptional for the given dataset, we trust that you can scale it effectively using the right tools.

<!-- ## Expected Deliverables -->
<h2 style="color: #fbb03c;">Expected Deliverables</h2>

<!-- 1. **Solution explanation / presentation**   -->
1. <span style="color: #fbb03c;"><strong>Solution explanation / presentation</strong></span>

   Provide an explanation or presentation of your solution and results. You have total creative freedom here—feel free to impress with your thinking process, the paths you took or decided not to take, the reasoning behind your decisions and what led to your approach.

<!-- 2. **Output**   -->
2. <span style="color: #fbb03c;"><strong>Output</strong></span>

   Your program should take one subdirectory at a time and output the grouped documents, something along the lines of:  
   `[A.html, B.html], [C.html], [D.html, E.html, F.html] ...`

<!-- 3. **Code and Logic**   -->
3. <span style="color: #fbb03c;"><strong>Code and Logic</strong></span>

   Include the code that enabled you to achieve this task for the provided list, and ideally, for any list of any size.
